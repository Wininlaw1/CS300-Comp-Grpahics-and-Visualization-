How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I start by laying out what materials i will use in my scene. This allows me to make sure i added everything needed to complete the software as entended. This project helped me craft new design skills like plcement in the objects. This helps me btter understand where objects go based on movement. For my project i followed basic concepts like setting up my light source, objects, textures, and a few others to capture my scene. I made a check list and went down it adding everything needed to propberly render the scene. I could use this on my future work because this planning and course set work can have a end goal. Allowing me to follow the nessary setup and follow the needed order of code.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

To approah developing programs i make sure there is not error in my code. Some new development straegies i used was adding libary i havent used before to make sure the shapes mesh was added. Now starting from the begining of this course i found unique ways to add iteration facor into my development. By going every week along with the assigments i was able to make sure by the time the project was due i would be more then done with editing my project. My use of developing code evolved throughout the milestones by getting more focus and understanding each milestone. Playng around with things , email the teacher when needed for comformation, and checking constantly for errors. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer Science can help me in reaching my goals by understanding how to make games and wireframes the best way i can. Making me a professional at not only coding my mobile applications but designing what i coded for properly. OpenGl will be useful with visualizations within data. This skills will make me the best UX/UI Designer i can be.
